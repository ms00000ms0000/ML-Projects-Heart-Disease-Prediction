# ML-Projects-Heart-Disease-Prediction
This **Machine Learning project** is a **Heart Disease Prediction System** developed using the **Logistic Regression** algorithm. It predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on medical attributes such as **Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type (cp), Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps), Cholesterol (chol), Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs), Resting ECG (restecg), Maximum Heart Rate (thalach), Exercise-Induced Angina (exang), Oldpeak, Slope, CA, and Thal**. Extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was performed to understand feature importance and correlations. The model achieved an **accuracy of 85%**, demonstrating its effectiveness in **early detection and cardiovascular risk assessment** using data-driven methods.
